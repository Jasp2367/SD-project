# SD-project Description
INTRODUCTION

In this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the Event Planning Management System (EPMS), several key components are outlined. The document begins with Definitions and Abbreviations, providing clarity on terms such as EPMS, SWOT, and SIPOC. The Document Purpose section establishes the SRS as a guide for the development, implementation, and maintenance of the EPMS. The Scope highlights the web application's five interconnected modules: Event Details, Guest Management, Vendor Coordination, Budget Tracking, and Task Scheduling, emphasizing user-friendliness and real-time collaboration. The document is based on a study project task, and its structure includes sections like Introduction, SWOT Analysis, SIPOC Analysis, Project Sustainability, Modular Diagram, Technologies, and Summary.

PROCESS DESCRIPTION

Illustrated with simplified system process diagrams and models (Figures 1-3), the EPMS functions as a web application to streamline event planning and management processes.

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

Under System User Administration (Section 3.1), Access Rights and User Administration specifications are detailed, defining roles and responsibilities for administrators in managing user data. Event Administration (Section 3.2) outlines access rights, event configuration details, and evaluation criteria, ensuring faculty members and clients have appropriate access levels. The Event section (3.3) covers access rights for event execution and the system's capability to create events according to specified conditions, providing clients with detailed results and financial data.

GENERAL LIMITATIONS

The development of EPMS involves using specific technologies: MySQL/Oracle for data storage, Python/C# for backend, and HTML/CSS/JS for frontend. Frameworks like Django and ASP.Net Core will be employed for web development. Server software may require Microsoft Windows, macOS, or Linux installation, and users need a compatible web browser such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Safari to interact with the system.
